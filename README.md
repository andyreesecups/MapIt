This is a passion project I did on the side while attending the UT Coding Bootcamp. I created this website using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and the Google Maps API. A little Javascript magic calculates the miles, and how long it will take to get to and from a destination. The Google Maps API also shows the route to your destination.
